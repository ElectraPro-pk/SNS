<p>SNS (Social Network Using SOLID) caters all privacy related issues faced by
users while using any social networking application. Socially Linked Data
(SOLID) architecture is used in the development of SNS that helps the user
decide where his data is being stored. It promotes the concept of true data
ownership and allows the user to control permissions as well as who can view
or share the data by using his personal database known as Personal Online
Data (POD).
</p><p>
The project includes eight modules, authentication, profile privacy, friend list
management, cloud data management, file sharing, chat, feedback
management and report generation.
</p><p>
Upon opening the application, user is asked to sign up if his/her account does
not exist and a unique POD is generated that will be connected to his account
through a web-id otherwise the user is asked to login to manage the account.
POD is used as database/data storage for userâ€™s data including files, posts,
pictures, messages, comments, likes etc. The user can manage the POD as
well like user can edit, delete, append, update etc. The goal is to provide the
user with true data ownership, reusability of data and modular design. </p>
